What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: You creat a .git file that makes it part of the git tracking system.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area is basically git's list of who to track. The current directory is all files whether or not the git is tracking them. The value it offers is that allows us to only work on files that need to be worked on without investing any effort on other files.
